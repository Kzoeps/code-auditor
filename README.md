# Code Auditor  (Karma Yoezer)

This is my project for the SELISE phase 2 interview. The code audit management app allows users to assign teams to audit work and to create memos. more details of it is saved as code-audit-tracker.pdf file in the root folder. 

## Development server

First run `json-server --watch db.json` to run the backend server.

Then run `ng serve --open` in another terminal tab for a dev server which will automatically navigate to `https://localhost:4200`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Important Info
The Admin Email is: admin@admin.com

password is: admin@123.

For the authentication and the privlige of each user I could only finish about half and was unable to finish the privilege for audit. 
This is in reference to only auditor team members being able to assign audits. Due to time shortage I was unable to work on the UI as well so it is very skeletal.

All the functionalities have been created but like i said the authentication and the privilige of who gets to use the functionalities is half done as i havent completed it fully.
