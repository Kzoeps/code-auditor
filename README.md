# Code Auditor  (Karma Yoezer)

This is my project for the SELISE phase 2 interview. The code audit management app allows users to assign teams to audit work and to create memos. more details of it is saved as a pdf file in the root folder. 

## Development server

First run `json-server --watch db.json` to run the backend server.

Then run `ng serve --open` in another terminal tab for a dev server which will automatically navigate to `https://localhost:4200`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
